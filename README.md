# Epicoin
Epita S2 Project. Epicoin is a blockchain system where the proof of work is replaced by the solving of NP-Complete problems.
The project's official website is www.againai.ml ; there you can find additional information about it and its authors.
The project was fulfilled to the very end, but because of school rulings, we are not allowed to publish it on Github.
